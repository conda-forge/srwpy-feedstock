  description: |
    SRW is a physical optics computer code for calculation of detailed characteristics of
    Synchrotron Radiation (SR) generated by relativistic electrons in magnetic fields of
    arbitrary configuration and for simulation of the radiation wavefront propagation 
    through optical systems of beamlines.
